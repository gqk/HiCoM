## üóûÔ∏è News
- [2024/12/19] Code released.
- [2024/10/29] Camera ready submitted.
- [2024/09/26] Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 as poster presentation!

## ‚öôÔ∏è Experiment

The code is built on [LibGS](https://github.com/Awesome3DGS/LibGS); please familiarize yourself with it before running the experiments.

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install .
   ```

2. Run pipeline

   ```
   python main.py --config=config/dynerf.yaml --data.root=<PATH TO SCENE ROOT>
   ```

   The `config` directory contains pre-defined configurations for reproducing the results reported in the paper.
